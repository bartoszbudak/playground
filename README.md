##### Current:

- This is a work in progress, I will be adding to this repo regularly
- Based off of Cracking the (Coding? Code? You know which one) Interview.
- Sometimes I'll do straight-up solutions, sometimes I might apply it to the web. Who knows?

  ### Feel free to roast my code.

  ###### Critiques welcome.

  ##### Todo

- Unit Tests, just wanted to get something up, current code not tested, be careful when forking
